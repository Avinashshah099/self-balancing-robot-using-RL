# self-balancing-robot-using-RL

This repository contains all the source code used throughout my under-graduate thesis for the degree of a Bachelor of Mechatronic engineering at The University of Sydney. The thesis was titled 'Balancing a Two Wheeled Robot with Reinforcement Learning' that has an aim of justifying Rienforcement Learning algorithms for use in the field of robotic actuated control systems. This thesis consisted of the development of a two-wheeled robot using ROS as its software archieture as well as three experiements:
- Rienforcement Learning algorithms in a grid world
- Control algorithms in a Gazebo simulation
- Control algorithms on the built two-wheeled robot


The thesis can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz08ndGq8YoiUlNWRVNkRlVtTEk). 

All code has been written in C++ with exception for a few python scripts.
